Ikariam Extension
=================

Playing around with Firefox Extension capabilities and providing some additional clientside tools for the browser game.

### Disclaimer

I do not claim to own the rights to the game. [Ikariam](https://gameforge.com/play/ikariam) is owned by [GameForge](https://gameforge.com/). All images used by the extension are publicly available and taken directly from the source and belong to GameForge. This is a non-commercial, personal project that simply adds additional clientside functionality. The extension acts on data provided to the client when logged-in; no signup is required and no data is stored or sent anywhere else. The source code is entirely public.

### Tasks

 - add a delete all read reports option for Combat Reports
 - show info of all troops in all towns at once
 - all ongoing building summary data
 - think about resource requirement calculators (ie: how long at current gather rate until I can afford upgrade)
